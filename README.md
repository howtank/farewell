# Howtank Farewell

 "March 31st, 2025 was the last day of service of Howtank. We want to thank all our customers, and just as importantly, all the users in communities across the world who made Howtank what it was: a place for genuine connections for people who shared a similar passion around topics and brands. This is the end of an era - but an era that was rich in experiences, human connections, and that will be engraved in our memories forever and that we will carry with us wherever we go and whatever we build next. This is also, therefore, a message of gratitude to all of you, and big cheers ðŸ¥‚ to new beginnings!"
